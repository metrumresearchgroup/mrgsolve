\title{Replicate a list of events into a data set}
\usage{
ev_assign(l, idata, evgroup, join = FALSE)

assign_ev(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{l}{list of event objects.}

\item{idata}{an idata set (one ID per row).}

\item{evgroup}{the character name of the column in \code{idata} that specifies
event object to implement.}

\item{join}{if \code{TRUE}, join \code{idata} to the data set before returning.}

\item{...}{used to pass arguments from \code{assign_ev()}.
to \code{ev_assign()}.}
}
\description{
Replicate a list of events into a data set
}
\details{
\code{ev_assign()} connects events in a list passed in as the \code{l} argument to
values in the data set identified in the \code{evgroup} argument.  For making
assignments, the unique values in the \code{evgroup} column are first sorted so
that the first sorted unique value in \code{evgroup} is assigned to the first
event in \code{l}, the second sorted value in \code{evgroup} column is assigned to the
second event in \code{l}, and so on.  This is a change from previous behavior,
which did not sort the unique values in \code{evgroup} prior to making the
assignments.

\examples{
ev1 <- ev(amt = 100)
ev2 <- ev(amt = 300, rate = 100, ii = 12, addl = 10)

idata <- data.frame(ID = seq(10)) 
idata$arm <- 1+(idata$ID \%\%2)

ev_assign(list(ev1, ev2), idata, "arm", join = TRUE)
