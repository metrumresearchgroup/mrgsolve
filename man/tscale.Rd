\title{Re-scale time in the simulated output}
\usage{
tscale(x, value = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{model object.}

\item{value}{value by which time will be scaled.}

\item{...}{not used.}
}
\description{
Re-scale time in the simulated output
}
\details{
There is also a \code{tscale} argument to \code{\link[=mrgsim]{mrgsim()}} that can
be set to accomplish the same thing as a call to \code{tscale} in
the pipeline.
}
\examples{
# The model is in hours:
mod <- mrgsolve::house()

# The output is in days:
mod \%>\% tscale(1/24) \%>\% mrgsim()

}
