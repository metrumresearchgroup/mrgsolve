\usage{
Req(x, ...)

req(x, ...)

\method{req}{mrgmod}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{model object.}

\item{...}{unquoted names of compartments or tabled items.}
}
\description{
Use this function to select, by name, either compartments or derived
variables that have been captured (see \link{CAPTURE}) into
the simulated output.
}
\details{
There is also a \code{Req} argument to \code{\link[=mrgsim]{mrgsim()}} that can
be set to accomplish the same thing as a call to \code{Req} in
the pipeline.

Note the difference between \code{req} and \code{Req}: the former only
selects compartments to appear in output while the latter selects both
compartments and captured items.  Also, when there are items explicitly
listed in \code{Req}, all other compartments or captured items not listed
there are ignored.  But when compartments are selected with \code{req}
all of the captured items are returned.  Remember that \code{req} is
strictly for compartments.
