\title{Schedule a series of event objects}
\usage{
ev_seq(..., ID = NULL, .dots = NULL, id = NULL)

\method{seq}{ev}(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{event objects or numeric arguments named \code{wait} or \code{ii} to
implement a period of no-dosing activity in the sequence (see \strong{Details}).}

\item{ID}{numeric vector of subject IDs.}

\item{.dots}{a list of event objects that replaces \code{...}.}

\item{id}{deprecated; use \code{ID}.}
}
\value{
A single event object sorted by \code{time}.
}
\description{
Use this function when you want to schedule two or more event objects in time
according the dosing interval (\code{ii}) and additional doses (\code{addl}).
}
\details{
Use the generic \code{\link[=seq]{seq()}} when the first argument is an event object.  If a
waiting period (\code{wait} or \code{ii}) is the first event, you will need to use
\code{\link[=ev_seq]{ev_seq()}}.  When an event object has multiple rows, the end time for that
sequence is taken to be one dosing interval after the event that takes place
on the last row of the event object.

The doses for the next event line start after all of the doses from the
previous event line plus one dosing interval from the previous event line
(see \strong{Examples}).

When numerics named \code{wait} or \code{ii} are mixed in with the event objects,
a period with no dosing activity is incorporated into the sequence,
between the adjacent dosing event objects. \code{wait} and \code{ii} accomplish a
similar result, but differ by the starting point for the inactive period.
\itemize{
\item Use \code{wait} to schedule the next dose relative to the end of the dosing
interval for the previous dose.
\item Use \code{ii} to schedule the next dose relative to the time of the the previous
dose.
}

So \code{wait} acts like similar to an event object, by starting the waiting
period from one dosing interval after the last dose while \code{ii} starts the
waiting period from the time of the last dose itself. Both \code{wait} and \code{ii}
can accomplish identical behavior depending on whether the last dosing
interval is included (or not) in the value. Values for \code{wait} or \code{ii} can
be negative.

\strong{NOTE}: \code{.ii} had been available historically as an undocumented feature.
Starting with mrgsolve version \verb{0.11.3}, the argument will be called \code{ii}.
For now, both \code{ii} and \code{.ii} will be accepted but you will get a deprecation
warning if you use \code{.ii}. Please use \code{ii} instead.

Values for \code{time} in any event object act like a prefix time spacer wherever
that event occurs in the event sequence (see \strong{Examples}).
