C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     DGEFA factors a double precision matrix by Gaussian elimination.
C
C     DGEFA is usually called by DGECO, but it can be called
C     directly with a saving in time if  RCOND  is not needed.
C     (Time for DGECO) = (1 + 9/N)*(Time for DGEFA) .
C
C     On Entry
C
C        A       DOUBLE PRECISION(LDA, N)
C                the matrix to be factored.
C
C        LDA     INTEGER
C                the leading dimension of the array  A .
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                the order of the matrix  A .
C
C     On Return
C
C        A       an upper triangular matrix and the multipliers
C                which were used to obtain it.
C                The factorization can be written  A = L*U  where
C                L  is a product of permutation and unit lower
C                triangular matrices and  U  is upper triangular.
C
C        IPVT    INTEGER(N)
C                an integer vector of pivot indices.
C
C        INFO    INTEGER
C                = 0  normal value.
C                = K  if  U(K,K) .EQ. 0.0 .  This is not an error
C                     condition for this subroutine, but it does
C                     indicate that DGESL or DGEDI will divide by zero
C                     if called.  Use  RCOND  in DGECO for a reliable
C                     indication of singularity.

C
C        A division by zero will occur if the input factor contains a

C        but it is often caused by improper arguments or improper
C        setting of LDA .  It will not occur if the subroutines are

C        or DGEFA has set INFO .EQ. 0 .

c$$$On many systems FORTRAN write and print statements can be used, but the output may not interleave

c$$$c$$$subroutine realpr(label, nchar, data, ndata)
c$$$c$$$subroutine intpr (label, nchar, data, ndata)
c$$$c$$$
c$$$c$$$Here label is a character label of up to 255 characters, nchar is its length
c$$$(which can be -1 if the whole label is to be used), and data is an array of length at
c$$$least ndata of the appropriate type (double precision, real and integer respectively).
c$$$These routines print the label on one line and then print data as if it were an R vector
c$$$ on subsequent line(s). They work with zero ndata, and so can be used to print a label alone.

*DECK XERRWD
      SUBROUTINE XERRWD (MSG, NMES, NERR, LEVEL, NI, I1, I2, NR, R1, R2)
C***  BEGIN PROLOGUE  XERRWD
C***  SUBSIDIARY
C***  PURPOSE  Write error message with values.
C***  CATEGORY  R3C
C***  TYPE      DOUBLE PRECISION (XERRWV-S, XERRWD-D)
C***  AUTHOR  Hindmarsh, Alan C., (LLNL)
C***  DESCRIPTION
C
C     Subroutines XERRWD, XSETF, XSETUN, and the function routine IXSAV,
C     as given here, constitute a simplified version of the SLATEC error
C     handling package.
C
C     All arguments are input arguments.
C
C     MSG    = The message (character array).
C     NMES   = The length of MSG (number of characters).
C     NERR   = The error number (not used).
C     LEVEL  = The error level..
C     0 or 1 means recoverable (control returns to caller).
C     2 means fatal (run is aborted--see note below).
C     NI     = Number of integers (0, 1, or 2) to be printed with message.
C     I1,I2  = Integers to be printed, depending on NI.
C     NR     = Number of reals (0, 1, or 2) to be printed with message.
C     R1,R2  = Reals to be printed, depending on NR.
C
C     Note..  this routine is machine-dependent and specialized for use
C     in limited context, in the following ways..
C     1. The argument MSG is assumed to be of type CHARACTER, and
C     the message is printed with a format of (1X,A).
C     2. The message is assumed to take only one line.
C     Multi-line messages are generated by repeated calls.
C     3. If LEVEL = 2, control passes to the statement   STOP
C     to abort the run.  This statement may be machine-dependent.
C     4. R1 and R2 are assumed to be in double precision and are printed
C     in D21.13 format.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  IXSAV saves and recalls one of two error message parameters:
C    LUNIT, the logical unit number to which messages are printed, and
C    MESFLG, the message print flag.
C  This is a modification of the SLATEC library routine J4SAVE.
C

C   LUNIT  = Logical unit number for messages.  The default is obtained
C            by a call to IUMACH (may be machine-dependent).
C   MESFLG = Print control flag..
C            1 means print all messages (the default).
C            0 means no printing.
C
C  On input..
C    IPAR   = Parameter indicator (1 for LUNIT, 2 for MESFLG).
C    IVALUE = The value to be set for the parameter, if ISET = .TRUE.
C    ISET   = Logical flag to indicate whether to read or write.
C             If ISET = .TRUE., the parameter will be given
C             the value IVALUE.  If ISET = .FALSE., the parameter
C             will be unchanged, and IVALUE is a dummy argument.
